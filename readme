For task1,
1. run "make -f MakefileTask1" from project directory
2.execute ./bin/mmprogram [size] [base] [coreNum] [controller1] [controller2]

size :the input matrix size
base: the recusion base size
coreNum: the core number with which the program run in parallel, default value is 272 (the total number of core in stampede2)
controller1: used to select which function to execute, default value is 1
controller2: used to select which function to execute, default value is 1


example:
./mmprogram 1024 256 
./mmprogram 1024 256 272
./mmprogram 1024 256 272 1 1
./mmprogram 1024 256 272 2 1
